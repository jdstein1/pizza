a pizza configurator for the web

## About 

This app is the platonic ideal of a pizza configuration mechanism.  It allows for complete customization of the pizza pie from toppings to bottom.

When you think of pizza, what do you think of first?  Most menus and electronic ordering methods assume you think of the size of the pizza first.  Does that make sense?  When I think of pizza, I think of how it tastes!  The flavor is the first thing that comes to my mind, not the size or the thickness.

Imagine the aroma of your freshly baked pie, then the texture as you bite into it, and then the tanginess of the sauce, saltiness of the cheese and the delicious combination of the toppings.

Order a pizza in a way that makes sense to your senses with Jeff Stein's Pizza Configurator for the Web (PCW)!
